            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Citizens LOSS, when the CHARTER of <hi>London</hi> is Forfeited, or given up.</head>
            <p>THere being ſo great a Murmur, and ſo much Diſcourſe, That the <hi>Charter</hi> of this City of <hi>London</hi> is to be made Forfeit, or elſe Surrendred by a <hi>Common-Councill,</hi> 'tis fit for every Member of the City to underſtand, that the meaning or intent of ſuch a Forfeiture or Surrender, is to diſſolve the Body Corporate or Politick of the City, to ſpoil it irrecoverably of all its Antient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Laws, Cuſtoms and Rights, which have been its Glory throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> near two thouſand years, to bring it into the ſame ſtate with the Country Villages, only capable to be Created a new Body Pollitick, by the Grace and Favour of his Majeſty, and to obtain ſuch Priviledges as the Crown can grant, which are infinitely inferiour to the Cuſtoms, Franchiſes, Rights and Government it now holds, by the Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It then there be any danger, either of a Forfeiture or Surrender of this City's <hi>Charter,</hi> every Member of it is concerned, not only in Intereſt but in Duty, to contribute what aſſiſtance he can to preſerve and ſecure it</p>
            <p>For that purpoſe every Citizen upon taking his Freedom is Sworn <hi>To maintain the Franchiſes and Cuſtoms of the</hi> CI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, <hi>and to keep the</hi> CITY <hi>harmleſs to his Power;</hi> and whatſoever Citizen ſhall openly attempt, or privately contrive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Corporation, or any of its Franchiſes, Cuſtoms, or Priviledges, betrays the Community, and violates his ſaid OATH, from which no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on Earth can abſolve.</p>
            <p>The means at preſent projected for the forfeiture of the <hi>Charter,</hi> and the utter Ruin of this Antient Body Pollitick, is the proſecution of a <hi>Quo Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> againſt it, aſſigning thereupon ſome ACTS of <hi>Common-Council,</hi> made and intended for the Citys well-fare, whereby is pretended a forfeiture of all its Priviledges, Authorities and Wealth, and its very being. As if it were reaſonable that a miſtake in a <hi>Common-Council</hi> in the extent of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (if any ſuch be) ſhould bring ſo great a City, and all its Members, no way concerned in ſuch miſtake, to ſuffer ſuch a heavy, dreadful and unheard of Judgment.</p>
            <p>The miſchievious and fatal Conſequencies of any Diſſolution of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Body Politick, are ſo many, that the wiſeſt and ableſt Lawyers cannot number them, nor foreſee the evils that may attend it, ſome of the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, are theſe that follow, <hi>(viz.)</hi>

            <p>But above all, there can be no Revival of that Solemn Confirmation of all the Liberties, Franchiſes, Free Cuſtoms, and Priviledges of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103599:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>by MAGNA CHARTA, which have been ſince renewed and confirmed thirty times in Parliament, many of which were accompanied with the the Invocation of Vengance upon the Infringers, of the ſame, and their Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Many Priviledges held by Antient <hi>Charter,</hi> of former Kings, if Loſt or Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, can never be reſtored by any new <hi>Charter</hi> from the Crown.</p>
            <p>The Citizens by antient <hi>Charter</hi> are exempted from the Duty to the Crown of <hi>Priſage</hi> of Wines; but if the Corporation be diſſolved, every Citizen is Diſ-franchiſed, and thereby made lyable to pay it; and the like exemption cannot be regranted by the King, at leaſt till the determination of a long Leaſe of the ſame duty in being, becauſe his former grant will prevent it during the Term.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> are very anciently exempted from Tolls throughout <hi>England;</hi> but if the Corporation be diſſolved, the Crown is barred from regranting the like by many Grants of the Tolls to others, from which no new exemption can be given.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch as read this ſmall Collection conſider, that the ancient and excellent Compoſition of Cuſtoms, Laws and Liberties in this City, made by the Wiſdom, and approved by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſo many Ages, confirmed by 23 Kings and 33 Parliments, muſt for ever be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces, with the loſs of its <hi>Charter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let them think, whether it be poſſible for any Man, or number of Men to foreſee the Diſtraction, Diſ-orders, and Miſchiefs, that may be the Event of ſuch a fatal ſtroak, to ſo great a Body Pollitick?</p>
            <p>The Children unborn may groan under ſuch Conſequences of it, as are not now intended, not can be imagined; who can tell when the Cryes of the Widdows and Orphans will ceaſe? the ſuppoſed Proviſion made for Citizens Wives and Children is void and null, if the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>No new <hi>Charter</hi> can give them any Right to their Cuſtomary Shares and Diviſions of their Husbands and Fathers Eſtates, ſo much depended upon in Marriages.</p>
            <p>The deluded Fathers muſt be vexed with new Cares, who have given great Portions with their Daughters to Citizens, upon conſideration only of the City Cuſtom, without taking Joyntures for them, or Proſpect of any other Dower.</p>
            <p>How great will be the Diſtraction and Confuſion in and about the Courts of Juſtice, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any Proviſion which can be made by any new <hi>Charter</hi> for other Courts.</p>
            <p>All Cauſes and Actions depending in the preſent Courts, and the proceedings therein muſt ceaſe, as if they had never been; and all Judgments obtained not executed, will be void and null, and no Citizen will know where, or how to ſeek his former wanted Releif, either in Law or Equity.</p>
            <p>All the Offices belonging to the City Courts of Juſtice muſt periſh with the Courts; and all the Officers belonging to them, who have obtained their places by purchaſe, or otherwiſe, muſt ſeek out new ways for Themſelves and Families.</p>
            <p>The ſame ſad Fate will attend all the Officers whoſe Offices depend upon the Government of the City, or its Magiſtrates, or its Revenue, and if any of them ſhould hope by Grace and Favour to obtain ſome new Office under a new <hi>Charter,</hi> they can never claim their old Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Fees.</p>
            <p>The preſent Orphans to whom the City owes their Portions muſt be turned to begging or ſtarving, or to live upon the future Charity of a new Corporation, when the Body Politick of the City ſhall be Diſſolved, no Creditor can Implead it for any Debt, neither can any of its Debtors be Impleaded.</p>
            <p>The Death of a Corporation reduceth it to nothing, and 'twill then be as if it had never been in reſpect of Debts or Credits, there can be no Succeſſor, Heir, or Executor to demand or anſwer for the Body that was.</p>
            <p>Therefore all the Goods and Chattels of the City muſt fall to the King, to be given and diſpoſed of, as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>And all its Lands and real Eſtate in the <hi>Exchange, Guild-Hall,</hi> &amp;c. muſt of right revert unto the Heirs of the Donors if there be any, or Eſcheat to the Crown, for want of ſuch Heirs.</p>
            <p>But the Face of Confuſion is ſo full of Horror, that will appear, after the Diſſolution of this mighty Body by Forfeiture or Surrender of its <hi>Charter,</hi> that I tremble to look upon it a far off.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſays, It would require a Vollumn of it ſelf, to Treat of the great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Franchiſes, Liberties and Cuſtoms of this City, and no leſs a Volumn would be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to diſcribe the Diſorders, Loſſes, Diſtractions, Miſchiefs and Confutions, that muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Deſtruction and the Death of ſo great a Body Politick.</p>
            <p>And the City of <hi>London</hi> by this means, which is now one of the Antienteſt City's in the whole World, will at the time of ſuch Surrender be the youngeſt City and Corporation in <hi>England.</hi>
